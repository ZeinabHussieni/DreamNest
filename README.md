# DreamNest

**DreamNest is where your dreams turn into action.** ‚ú®  
Write down your vision, and our AI transforms it into a personalized step-by-step plan to help you achieve it.  

But you won‚Äôt be alone on the journey. DreamNest‚Äôs **smart matching system** connects you with people who share similar goals or complementary skills. Once matched, you‚Äôll unlock a **private chat space** where you can exchange text, voice notes, and images.  

Beyond one-to-one connections, you can:  
- Share updates in the **community feed**  
- Track your progress in a **personal dashboard**  
- Stay safe with **built-in AI moderation**  

Meanwhile, **admins** have their own dashboard to keep the environment secure, supportive, and positive.

### Linear Board Screenshot
- Below is a screenshot of our Linear board, which we used to manage and track all project tasks during development:

<img src="./readme/screenshots/linear.jpg"/>

Workflow steps:

- Create a ticket in Linear for each new feature, fix, or enhancement.
- Create a Git branch that follows Linear‚Äôs naming conventions.
- Commit changes with the corresponding task ID included in the commit message.
- Push the branch to the remote repository.
- Open a pull request and request a review.
- Merge the pull request once it has been reviewed and approved.

### AI Agent

In DreamNest, the AI agent works like a **personal planning coach**.  
Its job is to take a user‚Äôs goal and turn it into a clear, step-by-step action plan that feels motivating and doable.  

Here‚Äôs how it works for the user:  

1. **The user chooses a goal**  
   Example: ‚ÄúGet fit in 3 months‚Äù or ‚ÄúLearn JavaScript.‚Äù  

2. **The agent creates a plan**  
   It breaks the user‚Äôs goal into 6‚Äì8 practical steps, each with:  
   - A short title (often with emojis üéØ‚ú®)  
   - A motivational description (like a mini pep-talk)  
   - A realistic due date (spaced across weeks or months)  

3. **The plan gets refined automatically**  
   If anything is missing (like a date or description), the agent fills it in so the plan always feels complete and ready to follow.  

4. **The user‚Äôs plan is saved**  
   The final plan is attached to the user‚Äôs goal inside DreamNest so every time the user logs in, there is a roadmap that guides them forward step by step.

### Development ‚Üí Deployment Flow

**Feature Development**  
- Work on new features begins inside a local branch.  
- The branch is pushed to its remote equivalent on GitHub.  

**Integration to Staging**  
- The remote feature branch is merged into the staging branch.  
- This triggers GitHub Actions workflows.  

**CI on Staging**  
- GitHub Actions provisions a temporary PostgreSQL database.  
- Prisma migrations run, automated tests execute, and the NestJS backend is booted in a test environment.  
- If all checks pass, the pipeline continues.  

**Staging Deployment**  
- GitHub Actions pushes code to the staging EC2 instance.  
- A deployment script builds Docker containers for:  
  - NestJS backend  
  - React frontend  
  - PostgreSQL database  
  - Redis/WebSockets service  
- Containers spin up and serve the staging environment.  

**Production Release**  
- Once the feature is approved, the staging branch is merged into the main branch.  
- GitHub Actions reruns the same pipeline steps, but deployment is directed to the production EC2 instance.

### Swagger & Postman Documentation

DreamNest provides a fully documented API that can be tested through **Swagger UI** or imported into **Postman**.  

- **Swagger UI** ‚Üí Test endpoints directly in your browser with clear parameter, request, and response examples.  
- **Postman Collection** ‚Üí Run API calls directly in Postman for fast debugging and local testing.  
- **Authentication Ready** ‚Üí Add your JWT token once to easily access all secured endpoints.  
- **Organized Reference** ‚Üí Endpoints are grouped by module (Auth, Goals, Posts, Chat, Notifications) for easy navigation.  

|Create Post `POST`                                | List Chatroom Messages `GET`                   | Notifications & Plans APIs                   |
